# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
Analysis of employee database using SQL, pgAdmin, and PostgreSQL

## Overview of the Analysis
Data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis: The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. I sketched an ERD of the tables to hold data, imported the CSVs into the database, and analyzed and evaluated new data to answer questions about title gaps in the company.
